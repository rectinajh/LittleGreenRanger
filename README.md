# LittleGreenRanger
This project is an energy tokenization platform based on the Solana blockchain. It records photovoltaic power generation data, generates corresponding tokens, and interacts with users' wallets, thereby integrating renewable energy production with blockchain technology to promote transparency in energy data and tokenized circulation.


# Project Development Phases

## Phase 1: Prototype and MVP Development
**Objective**: Build the core functionality to validate the concept.

### Deliverables:
1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Integration with data loggers to retrieve daily energy generation data via RS485.
   - Connect with different COM protocols to carry out feasibility studies.
   - Development of logic to aggregate energy data daily and ensure it tallies with inverters' data.
   - Create and deploy a basic SPL Token on Solana (1 kWh = 1 token/coin).
   - Implement token minting and distribution to user accounts.

2. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Develop an API service to receive data from loggers and store it in a lightweight database or cloud storage.
   - Daily data aggregation and availability through an API endpoint for blockchain integration.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test integration of logger data with the cloud and blockchain.
   - Deploy smart contracts on Solana's Devnet for initial testing.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Provide detailed documentation for the setup and use of the MVP.

## Phase 2: Web Application and Refinements
**Objective**: Enhance the MVP with a user-friendly web interface and address any issues from the prototype.

### Deliverables:
1. **Web Application**:
   - Create a frontend interface for users to:
     - Register and link their unique logger identifiers (logger_id).
     - View daily energy generation data and token balances.
     - Access token burning functionality.
   - Develop a backend system to manage token distribution and burning processes.

2. **Refinements**:
   - Address bugs, discrepancies, or functional issues identified in Phase 1.
   - Optimize daily data aggregation and tokenization logic.

3. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive testing of frontend and backend systems, including edge cases (e.g., logger disconnection, data loss).
   - Test token burning operations for accuracy and transparency.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the web application to a staging environment for user testing.

## Phase 3: Finalization and Commissioning
**Objective**: Deliver a production-ready product with all features functional and tested.

### Deliverables:
1. **Final Integration**:
   - Ensure seamless data flow between loggers, cloud, blockchain, and user interfaces.
   - Deploy smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.
   - Deploy data collection services to the production cloud environment (e.g., AWS).

2. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Implement encryption for data privacy during transmission and storage.
   - Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy and financial regulations.

3. **System Commissioning**:
   - Launch the system for public use.
   - Provide user training and detailed documentation for the final product.

4. **Feedback and Iteration**:
   - Collect user feedback for future iterations.
   - Address minor adjustments post-launch.
